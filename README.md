# Ensemble-ML-Breast-Cancer
This repository contains an implementation of three ML algorithms built from scratch: K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and a Feed-Forward Neural Network, for classifying breast cancer. The code compares the accuracy of these models and calculates an ensemble accuracy score.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository

2. Install Dependencies

pip install numpy scikit-learn

3. Run the code

python3 ensemble_model.py

## Output
The code prints the accuracy of each model and the ensemble accuracy.
